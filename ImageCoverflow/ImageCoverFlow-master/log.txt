ImageCoverFlow is not extends from Gallery which has been deprecated by google.

version 1.0
supported:
1. Layout padding by using attribute “android:layout_paddingxxx”.(top, bottom, left, 
   right)

2. Gravity by using attribute “coverflowGravity”.(top, bottom, center_vertical)

3. Layout mode by using attribute “coverflowLayoutMode”.(match_parent, wrap_content. 
   When using this attribute, will scale image to match parent’s height or keep it’s own
   height, and parent’s height may change with image’s.)

4. Image Reflection by using attribute “enableReflection”, and users can set an reflection
   height fraction based on image’s original height. A reflection gap can be set too.

5. Image looping. This can’t be set, it is default and only mode provided.

6. Center image locking like gallery.

8. Image cache.(It has already achieve an image cache, but i propose users to achieve an
   cache outside.)
